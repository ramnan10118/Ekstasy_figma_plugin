## Setup

### For Team Members (Using Pre-built Plugin)
See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for simple installation instructions.

### For Developers/Team Admins

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure OpenAI API Key**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

3. **Build the Plugin**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Load in Figma**:
   - Open Figma Desktop
   - Go to Plugins ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Import plugin from manifest
   - Select the `manifest.json` file in this directory

## Usage

1. **Open the Plugin**: 
   - In Figma, go to Plugins ‚Üí Grammar Checker
   
2. **Automatic Scanning**: 
   - Plugin immediately scans all text layers (no setup required!)
   - View issues organized by layer or text
   
3. **Review & Fix**:

   - Click "Apply Fix" for individual issues
   - Use "Auto fix all" for bulk corrections

- **Build**: `npm run build` - Production build

## How It Works

1. **Text Extraction**: Scans all text layers in the current Figma page
2. **AI Analysis**: Sends text to OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent grammar/spell checking
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Provides accurate corrections and improvements
4. **Non-Destructive**: All changes can be undone using Figma's history
5. **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple text layers simultaneously

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Zustand state management
- **AI Service**: OpenAI GPT API integration for grammar analysis
- **Build Tool**: Webpack with TypeScript compilation
- **Styling**: CSS with Figma design system patterns

## API Usage

The plugin uses OpenAI's GPT models to analyze text for grammar and spelling errors. You'll need an OpenAI API key for usage. For team deployment, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).
